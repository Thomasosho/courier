                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Welcome to Delta Elite Courier Service, We started with just one 
                        vehicle. After several years it had expanded to Sixty five vehicles 
                        gaining a reputation of reliability with a friendly approach to its 
                        customers. The company was incorporated and became a limited company
                         with the Head office based in Germany.
                        The company started by offering Next Day or Same Day delivery options.
                         Delta Elite Courier Service Ltd and their staff pride themselves 
                         on being able to handle with care all types of items ranging from 
                         delicate filtration equipment for hospital operating theatres to 
                         large awkward sign boards, all items are handle with the same care.
                        The company then expanded into the Home Delivery Service and then we 
                        soon gained a reputation for delivering Medical and associated products 
                        to patients in their own homes a reputation that has only got better 
                        and better over 6 decades.
                        During 2001 due to requests from our largest client we opened a Depot 
                        in Essex to service new and exciting business in Germany. Business 
                        increased based on reputation as a reliable delivery operation and 
                        another depot was required to service was opened. Eighteen months 
                        later due to logistical reasons the two depots we amalgamated to 
                        Paddock Wood Kent operating with over 138 vehicles and 1470 staff.
                        In 2004 Delta Elite Courier Service Ltd was invited by a valued 
                        customer Paul Hartmann Ltd, to move its Heywood Operation into their 
                        premises. The decision to do so gave enormous advantages to both parties 
                        with increased communication and service levels.
                        During early 2009 it was decided to invest in a tracking system for our
                         delivery vehicles that could incorporate a routing facility that would 
                         provide information on when where and how a delivery was made. This system 
                         was trailed with TomTom Work and was very successful. TomTom work was when 
                         fitted to all our vehicles by our own in-house fitter. In late 2010 in 
                         conjunction with our TomTom Work project Delta Elite Courier Service
                          Ltd are proud to announce the launch of globalgoosecourierservices-de.com. 
                          This will give new and existing clients the facility of consignment tracking 
                          and online ordering for collections.
                        During the last few years of unforeseen weather conditions it has been 
                        decided to provide each one of our depots with a 4 wheel drive vehicle 
                        to aid recovery of stranded delivery vehicles and if necessary deliver 
                        consignments urgently required to locations that it would be impossible 
                        for a normal vehicle to achieve.
